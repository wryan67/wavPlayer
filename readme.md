wavPlayer
---------
Read standard .wav file and write PCM data to ALSA driver.  If you're not familiar with ALSA, it's a very good and mature framework that provides an universal API to access and use sound card devices.  I'm currently using it to play music over an USB sound card on a Raspberry Pi zero.  Here are some links which describe ALSA in more detail.

## Prerquisite

To compile, you will need to install the ALSA dev library:

    $ sudo apt install libasound2-dev
    
## Download & switching branches
After cloning the repository, you'll need to switch to the alsa branch:

    $ git clone https://github.com/wryan67/wavPlayer.git
    $ git checkout alsa
    
## Compiling

    make


## Device discovery
Use aplay to find your default devices:

    $ aplay -L | grep ^default
    default:CARD=ALSA
    default:CARD=Device

## Environment variable

Setup your audio device like this:

    $ export AUDIODEV="default:CARD=Device"
    
## Executing
After you find your sound card and setup the AUDIODEV environment variable, you should be ready to test.

    $ ./wavPlayer -d ~/rr-crossing-bells.48k.wav
    Playing /home/wryan/rr-crossing-bells.48k.wav...
