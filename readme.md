wavPlayer
---------
Read standard .wav file and write PCM data to ALSA driver.  If you're not familiar with ALSA, it's a very good and mature framework that provides an universal API to access and use sound card devices.  I'm currently using it to play music over an USB sound card on a Raspberry Pi zero.  Here are some links which describe ALSA in more detail.

## Prerquisite

To compile, you will need to install the ALSA dev library:

    $ sudo apt install libasound2-dev
    
## Download & switching branches
After cloning the repository, you'll need to switch to the alsa branch:

    $ git clone https://github.com/wryan67/wavPlayer.git
    $ cd wavPlayer
    $ git checkout alsa
    
## Compiling
I use Visual Studio, so if you're comfortable with VS, just open the .sln file.   If you're not so confortable with VisualStudio, or you just want to work directly on the RPi, then change folders again to the subdirectory "wavPlayer", and use make to compile the program.

    $ cd wavPlayer
    make


## Device discovery
Use aplay to find your default devices.  I typically use the grep ^default because aplay -L by itself reads like a dictionary. 

    $ aplay -L | grep ^default
    default:CARD=ALSA
    default:CARD=Device

Or use my handy shell script which gives a little more info than the above command, and also provides the audio environment variable needed in the next step:

    $ ./listSoundCards.sh
    bcm2835 ALSA, bcm2835 ALSA
      export AUDIODEV='default:CARD=ALSA'

    Generic USB Audio Device, USB Audio
      export AUDIODEV='default:CARD=Device'


## Environment variable

Setup your audio device like this:

    $ export AUDIODEV='default:CARD=Device'

I recommend putting the export command in your .bashrc script so that it is available after each reboot.

## Executing
After you find your sound card and setup the AUDIODEV environment variable, you should be ready to test.

    $ ./wavPlayer -d ~/rr-crossing-bells.48k.wav
    Playing /home/wryan/rr-crossing-bells.48k.wav...
